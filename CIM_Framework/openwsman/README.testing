# How to set up a testing environment


## Running openwsman server

Testing needs a running `openwsmand` service which can connect
to a CIM broker.

This can be achieved by running `make install` followed by
`sudo openwsman -d` or by

```
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=src/lib:src/authenticators/file ./src/server/openwsmand -d -c ../etc/openwsman_test.conf -a `pwd`/src/authenticators/file -b `pwd`/../etc/test_simple_auth.passwd -P `pwd`/src/plugins/cim
```

from the `build` directory.

## Running a CIM server

sfcb (small footprint cim broker) is used as the CIM broker. It should
have the 'cmpi-base' CIM provider available.


## Authentication

It is assumed that a 'wsman' user exists with password 'secret'.

This user should be in the 'sfcb' group.


## Testing under (open)SUSE

zypper in sblim-sfcb
zypper in sblim-cmpi-base


Start sblim-sfcb

> sudo sfcbd



## Running tests

> cd build
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/src/lib
> make test

Note: When running openwsmand from the local build directory as
outlined above, this will fail all `identify` tests since the
respective plugin isn't loaded.

You can change the last parameter (`-P`) to end with `/identify`
(instead of `/cim`) to just make the identity tests pass.
